# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

#This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. The backend of this project is built using Python Flask and the machine learning model is built using the Random Forest algorithm. The frontend of the project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using Git by running the following command:

git clone <repository-url>

  
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask app using the following command:
python app.py

Open your browser and navigate to the URL http://localhost:5000 to access the frontend of the application
  
The trained model can take reports with patient information and predict the probability of heart disease.

Future improvements:

Increase the dataset size and include more features to improve the accuracy of the model.
Use other machine learning algorithms for comparison purposes.
Improve the frontend design and add more features
